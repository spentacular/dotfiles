# Summarize changes in around 50 characters or less
#
# More detailed explanatory text, if necessary. Wrap it to about 72
# characters or so. In some contexts, the first line is treated as the
# subject of the commit and the rest of the text as the body. The
# blank line separating the summary from the body is critical (unless
# you omit the body entirely); various tools like `log`, `shortlog`
# and `rebase` can get confused if you run the two together.
#
# Explain the problem that this commit is solving. Focus on why you
# are making this change as opposed to how (the code explains that).
#
# This should answer:
#
# * Why was this change necessary?
# * How does it address the problem?
# * Are there any side effects?
